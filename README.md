## concepts
API: An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.

## step by step

1 download [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2 download [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3 download [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

4 create server: new folder with project name in this case first-rest-api

5 open console windows cmd  or terminal inside vs code for next step

6 create package.json using :

express is a node framework that is helful for writting information to the server and morgan lets us see in console incoming requests.

8 create new folder src (source)

9 inside src folder create new file index.js

10 in index.js require express
```const express = require('express');``` or
```import express from 'express';  ```(es module)

11 in index.js create app variable
```const app = express();```

12 in index.jsapp listen in port 3000  and log connection
```app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server on port ${3000}`)
